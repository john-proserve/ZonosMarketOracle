I am going to provide you a CSV with the following information:
day,region,country,total_visitors,total_sessions,total_pageviews,avg_duration,bounce_rate,total_carts,total_checkouts,total_conversion

I want you to output the CSV information in the following format:
Date Range: <start_date> to <end_date>
Number of Days: <days_count>

<country> Data:
- Average Visitors per Day: <country_visitor_average>
- Average Sessions per Day: <country_session_average>
- Average Pageviews per Day: <country_pageviews_average>
- Average Session Duration: <country_avg_duration>
- Average Bounce Rate: <country_bounce_rate_average>
- Average Total Carts per Day: <country_total_carts_average>
- Average Total Checkouts per Day: <country_total_checkouts_average>
- Average Conversion Rate: <country_conversion_rate_average>

For averages round to the nearest whole number.

Here is the CSV information:
